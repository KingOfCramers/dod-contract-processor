CORRECTION: The contract modification originally announced on March 15, 2017, for the Boeing Co., Mesa, Arizona, inaccurately identified the modification solely as a foreign military sales contract to Saudi Arabia. The modification was actually to an Apache multi-year contract W58RGZ-16-C-0023 (inclusive of foreign military sales – Saudi Arabia). Additionally, there was an error in the obligated funds, as the Fiscal 2010 funding was previously announced as other procurement (Army); it is actually foreign military sales. All other information in the announcement was correct.
