DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY 
  
The Microelectronics Advanced Research Corp. (MARCO), Durham, North Carolina, has been awarded a $15,470,282 modification (P00020) to previously awarded agreement HR0011-13-3-0002 exercising the fourth option for Year 5 of the Focus Center Research Program (FCRP) - Semiconductor Technology Advanced Research Network (STARnet). This is another transaction agreement. The modification brings the total cumulative face value of the agreement (government share) to $76,062,957 from $60,592,675. The non-federal (performer) cost share amount is increased to $114,283,492 from $91,078,069. The goal of this program is to create and continue a nationwide network of multi-university research centers that will keep the Department of Defense and U.S. semiconductor and defense systems firms at the forefront of the global microelectronics revolution. These centers will be focused on discovering solutions to the intractable problems that are forecast to lie in the future of integrated circuit progress and to lay the foundations for microsystems innovations once the improvements associated with Moore’s Law are exhausted. Work will be performed at the following FCRP - STARnet University Focus Centers: Center for Spintronic Material, Interfaces and Novel Architectures (C-SPIN) – University of Minnesota; Function Accelerated nanoMaterial Engineering (FAME) – University of California, Los Angeles; Center for Low Energy Systems Technology (LEAST) – University of Notre Dame; Center for Future Architectures Research (C-FAR) – University of Michigan; Systems On Nanoscale Information fabriCs (SONIC) Center – University of Illinois; and TerraSwarm Research Center (TSRC) – University of California, Berkeley, with an estimated completion date of January 2018. Fiscal 2016 and 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $7,685,396 are being obligated at time of award.
